D\u0026rsquo;année en année ce chiffre ne fait qu\u0026rsquo;augmenter (+1% par rapport à 2023). L\u0026rsquo;un de leurs principaux usages qui en est fait est l\u0026rsquo;utilisation des plateformes de réseaux sociaux. 78% des français les utilisent régulièrement et se rendent en moyenne sur environ 6 plateformes différentes par mois. Le trio des plateformes les plus plébiscitées est Facebook, WhatsApp et Instagram.\nBien que de plus en plus connectés et utilisateurs de réseaux sociaux, les français ont moins passé de temps sur ces plateformes que l\u0026rsquo;année dernière avec 1h48 par jour soit 7 minutes de moins. Malheureusement, cela cache beaucoup de disparités. La plateforme TikTok bat tous les records cette année avec un temps moyen passé sur l\u0026rsquo;application de 38h38 par ses utilisateurs actifs, soit plus de 12% d\u0026rsquo;augmentation! Quand on connaît l\u0026rsquo;algorithme qui se cache derrière cette application et la proportion d\u0026rsquo;adolescents de 13-17 ans (28%) qui utilisent cette plateforme, cela fait peur!\nImpact des réseaux sociaux sur l’environnement # En me basant sur la technique utilisée, et documentée, par Greenspector pour évaluer l\u0026rsquo;impact environnemental en 2023, je vous actualise les chiffres pour 2024, en prenant en hypothèse que les éditeurs de réseaux sociaux n\u0026rsquo;ont pas modifié l\u0026rsquo;efficacité de leur plateforme.\nParcours utilisateur évalué par Greenspector # Un seul et même parcours a été utilisé pour mesurer l\u0026rsquo;impact environnemental des plateformes:\nEtape 1 : lancement de l’application Etape 2 : lecture du fil d’actualité sans défilement (30 sec) Etape 3 : défilement du fil d’actualité avec des pauses intercalées. Etape 4 : mise en arrière-plan de l’application (30 sec) Résultats de l\u0026rsquo;évaluation du parcours utilisateur # D\u0026rsquo;après Greenspector, LinkedIn est l\u0026rsquo;application la moins impactante de la liste, avec un très faible volume de données échangées entre le matériel utilisateur et les serveurs, et une faible consommation énergétique (13 mAh) soit 15% de moins par rapport aux autres applications évaluées. TikTok arrive en bonne dernière position des tests réalisés. Elle est très énergivore à son lancement avec 22 mAh consommés. Sa consommation de données est phénoménale (environ 5 Mo) puisqu\u0026rsquo;elle précharge toutes les vidéos et photos pendant 30 secondes après son lancement pour une utilisation hors ligne.\nLes paramètres de Greenspector pour calculer l\u0026rsquo;impact environnemental de leur parcours utilisateur sont :\ntrois itérations de mesure de la consommation en énergie, en mémoire et en échange de données et de mesure du temps de réponse sur Greenspector Test Runner avec un smartphone en local (Samsung 10, Android 10, Réseau WiFi, Luminosité à 50%); les utilisateurs sont localisés en France, accèdent via leur smartphone aux services proposés par des serveurs d\u0026rsquo;architecture complexe répartis dans le monde (à défaut d’avoir les informations pour chacune des applications). Projection sur un an de l\u0026rsquo;impact environnemental # Quand on projette l’impact environnemental de l\u0026rsquo;usage annuel sur chaque application de réseaux sociaux, nous constatons une énorme variation entre le moins impactant (LinkedIn - 310g équivalent CO2) et le plus impactant (TikTok - 26,7kg équivalent CO2).\nUn français, utilisateur régulier de l\u0026rsquo;application TikTok, a un impact climatique annuel équivalent à rouler avec une voiture thermique sur 123km. Sachant que TikTok totalise près de 21 millions d\u0026rsquo;utilisateurs français actifs en 2024 (source: digitiz), l\u0026rsquo;usage de TikTok par les français en 2024 correspond à un équivalent de 64 000 tours du monde en voiture! A titre de comparaison, les français parcourent 1000 tours du monde en voiture en utilisant LinkedIn en 2024.\nUn effort doit vraiment être fait par les éditeurs de ces applications pour réduire cet impact vertigineux. Nous devons aussi questionner un peu nos usages concernant ces applications. Est-ce vraiment utile?\nL’Ademe propose un convertisseur en ligne Impact CO2 pour fournir une représentation de ces nombres barbares (poids en équivalent CO2) compréhensible pour tous.

So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes). Round table moderated by Delphine Seitiee (Alp ICT) with Florian Revaz (ISIT-CH), Laura Tocmacov (ImpactIA) and Sylvain Rossy (AI Swiss).\nAI and the environment # Without prior introduction, Delphine turned to Florian to ask him THE question on everyone\u0026rsquo;s lips: why is Artificial Intelligence so polluting? Florian began by explaining that AI requires hardware and infrastructure. The computing power needed to train machines on mathematical models is simply phenomenal. The need is such that major manufacturers like NVidia are innovating at a frenetic pace to deliver more computing power. This comes at an ecological price: the impact on the raw materials extracted from the ground, on the water and fossil fuels used to extract and transform all this into servers. In addition to the machines, we also have to build data centres, which also have a significant impact: cement, water for the buildings, energy and water to cool the servers, etc. Between 2022 and 2026, the energy demand for AI will double, and will be between the energy consumption of a country like Switzerland and the energy consumption of Germany! Amazon has announced a 30% increase in its water consumption due to AI. Microsoft has announced a 20% increase.\nArtificial Intelligence is also a bet to solve or help us solve our environmental problems.\n-Florian Revaz\nLaura goes on to explain that, in fact, it\u0026rsquo;s all a question of use. And to make good use of it, we need to focus on understanding what Artificial Intelligence is, what it\u0026rsquo;s for, and what it\u0026rsquo;s not for. This will give you the awareness you need to start designing mathematical models that have as little impact as possible. So you need to get acculturated by doing your first AI project. This acculturation is essential if you are to decide to apply AI to the right use cases.\nBusiness departments often consider that IT is a blocker in the implementation of AI within the company.\n-Laura Tocmacov\nSylvain adds that there is a risk of shadow IT developing in business departments. He confirms that there are already plenty of AI projects being carried out \u0026ldquo;on the sly\u0026rdquo; in large companies. The proliferation of these projects would have an extremely negative impact on the environment.\nAI and ethics # Delphine then asked Laura about the ethical issues surrounding Artificial Intelligence, and she listed 8 interesting issues:\nAligning the values of AI with the values of the company AI must not be developed at the expense of the planet. The biases of mathematical models and the non-diversity of data Who are the trainers of AI? AI must represent a diversity of people, which means that it must be trained by many different people, using data from many different cultures. Who are the users of AI? To avoid Artificial Intelligence being for an elite only. Who decides what is just and moral? Artificial intelligence is built and trained overwhelmingly by North American giants. Their culture of puritanism has produced Artificial Intelligences that censor erotic news. Does this decision include European culture? Have we, Europeans, had the right to choose? Artificial Intelligence and Open-Source: avoiding dependence on companies that are becoming more powerful than states. Delphine then asked the experts whether, in terms of generative AI, there were any models that were more ethical, more open and more transparent than the others. And incredibly, the answer was Facebook, or rather Meta! Meta has built its LLaMa project as an open-source project, open to everyone. Anyone can contribute to making it evolve. It\u0026rsquo;s completely free.\nA final word # We must be vigilant to ensure that Artificial Intelligence does not supplant local digital sovereignty. Regulations are coming, and in particular the European IA Act, which will put pressure on companies in the way they manage this technology, with the possibility of very large penalties. This law is already scaring Apple, which has decided to block the use of the Artificial Intelligence embedded in the new iPhone 16 in Europe. In Switzerland, there are plans underway for nano-taxation on the use of generative AI, so that funds can be redirected to social insurance. It will be interesting to follow this project closely!\nWe must be vigilant to ensure that Artificial Intelligence does not diminish our fundamental rights! The closing sentence of this round table sums up the need for acculturation in this new technology: Knowledge is power!\n","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/sitf2024-environnement-ethique-ia-table-ronde/","section":"Posts","summary":"Round table on integrating intelligence into your business while respecting your own environmental and ethical values at the Swiss IT forum(s) 2024 held on 26 and 27 September at Palexpo (Geneva)","title":"Artificial intelligence, environment and ethics","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/cbtw/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CBTW","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"4 October 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/tags/circularit/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CircularIT","type":"tags"},{"content":" This year, I had the opportunity to go to the Swiss IT forum(s) to meet the Green IT players in French-speaking Switzerland.

Demonstration of CircularIT by Ivan Mariblanca Flinch (MIKUJY) MIKUJI, formerly Canopé, based in Neuchatel, and closely linked to the Swiss association for sustainable ITISIT-CH, of which Ivan is the head of the scientific committee.\nBefore presenting his company, Ivan starts with a shock question:\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know how long it takes on average for the carbon footprint of using a smartphone to equal the carbon footprint of building it? 346 years!\u0026rdquo;\n-Ivan Mariblanca Flinch\nHe invites us to reflect on our irreasonable consumption of electronic equipment. What if we tried to extend the lifespan of our equipment by replacing new purchases with reconditioned ones, or by donating our old equipment that is still functional to relatives or people in need?\nAfter this shocking question, Ivan presented his company, MIKUJY, and in particular its mission:\n\u0026ldquo;We measure and help companies to reduce the carbon footprint of their information systems and support them throughout their sustainable digital journey.\u0026rdquo;\nMIKUJY is unique in that it is the first Swiss company to offer an all-in-one solution with:\nAn assessment of IT\u0026rsquo;s footprint on the 8 measurable environmental indicators and the maturity of organisations in relation to sustainable IT practices; Strategy creation; The creation of action plans; Change management, by promoting employee awareness via workshops enhanced by didactic videos and games calling on collective intelligence Certification training for employees; And certification in sustainable IT. MIKUJY is the only company to certify organisations on sustainable IT in Switzerland (NR label from the ISIT-CH association).\nTo support MIKUJI\u0026rsquo;s activities, Ivan introduced us to the various modules of the CircularIT web platform.\nMeasureIT # This 1st module aims to help companies measure the environmental footprint of their information systems using the Life Cycle Assessment method. Here too, the solution seems to make it easy to collect the inventory, either manually or automatically via an API. CircularIT\u0026rsquo;s well thought-out and polished interface makes it easy to visualise data reports and compare them with other companies already studied.\nThanks to subsidies from the OFEV (Federal Office for the Environment), MIKUJY is able to assess the environmental footprint of your IS and compare it with that of your peers, all at no cost to you! Contact them! PredictIT # This module simulates the future IT footprint and provides advice for optimal decisions. It models the evolution of the environmental footprint of an IS in response, for example, to changes in the lifespan and quantity of devices. This makes it much easier to take decisions on selecting the most relevant actions to implement.\nKey ambitions:\nAnticipate the digital footprint; Optimise digital assets and reduce costs; Align IT objectives with environmental objectives; Simplify strategic decision-making; Improve transparency and predictability. ImplementIT # Implementing a sustainable IT strategy is crucial to significantly reducing the environmental impact of digital. This module provides each department with its concrete actions to implement, facilitating and accelerating the adoption and deployment of the sustainable IT strategy.\nMain ambitions:\nPrioritise actions according to an organisation\u0026rsquo;s maturity; Implement SMART objectives; Monitor live the evolution of an organisation\u0026rsquo;s maturity, by department; Produce a strategy progress report. GameIT # The aim of this latest module is to encourage employees to make the transition to sustainable IT by having fun through learning and taking part in interactive games.\nMain ambitions:\nFun and profitable challenges Involve employees in the sustainable IT strategy Provide over 50 actions to implement Identify ambassadors Ivan reveals the availability of a major feature for a future version of CircularIT: measuring the impact of \u0026ldquo;Machine Learning\u0026rdquo;, a field of study in artificial intelligence aimed at giving machines the ability to learn from data and mathematical models.

I really appreciated this introduction. On the other hand, the various existing tools for decarbonising the value chain and how to choose them is a subject that is far too \u0026ldquo;tool\u0026rdquo; oriented for my liking.\nHowever, there were three things I would take away from this round table:\nThere is a plethora of tools on the decarbonisation market, as shown in the photo below. The main criteria for selecting a tool are: the size of the company (SME, ETI, GE), the price of the solution and the level of expertise on the subject required to make full use of the tool. Software publishers are focusing their efforts on making it easy to retrieve data. The generation of regulatory reports is no longer so much a means of differentiating these solutions. When I compare these solutions to the \u0026ldquo;niche players\u0026rdquo; in Green IT, which only measure digital impact but on many indicators other than carbon alone, I find that these publishers have fallen behind in their ability to help people make decisions and take action. Benoit was the only one who kept hammering away at this message: a good point that has engraved the name of his Odoo solution in my head.

Workshop led by Celine Carle-Faye (Resilio), referent for the Digital Collage in Switzerland, and Laurent Puijalon (Redsen Consulting).\nThe Digital Collage is a fun, collaborative half-day workshop with a similar pedagogy to that of the Climate Fresk. The aim of this \u0026ldquo;serious game\u0026rdquo; is to raise awareness and educate participants about the environmental challenges of digital technology.\nCeline took up the challenge of introducing the workshop in 20 minutes, stopwatch in hand! After a brief explanation of the digital collage, its format and its purpose, Celine and Laurent positioned us around a table to begin the 1st stage of a digital collage: understanding the subject. To do this, the group of participants had to read out their card(s) in an intelligible voice. Then the group had to link the cards together according to the dependencies between them.\nThe initial cards were\n\u0026ldquo;Sharing and learning\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Communicating\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;play and have fun\u0026rdquo;. We then had to position/link cards such as:\n\u0026ldquo;Cloud \u0026amp; Data centres, \u0026ldquo;WiFi, 4G/5G, networks\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Ecological backpack\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Using a console, smartphone or computer\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Electricity consumption\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Internet use\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Consumption of fossil fuels\u0026rdquo;. Each card included an explanation of its impact on the environment.\nAs time was very limited, Celine and Laurent gave us a quick explanation of the 3 other stages of a digital collage:\nThe creativity phase, during which the participants illustrate what they have said and the messages they have retained The presentation phase, during which each group presents its fresco to the other groups The action phase, during which the actions are classified according to two criteria: ease of implementation and degree of impact. This structuring of the actions enables the groups to quickly identify the quick-wins to be implemented (high impact \u0026amp; ease of implementation). To find out more about the digital collage, I encourage you to visit the association\u0026rsquo;s official website. Thank you to the organisers for taking up the challenge of showing us how to create a digital collage in 20 minutes.

The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes). Conference hosted by Estelle Veille, Lydia Allet and Thibault Couhin from Collaboration Betters The World\nLydia and Estelle presented a few practices aimed at reducing the environmental impact of projects, helping to reconcile innovation with sustainability. This list of actions is an excerpt from the eco-design checklist made available by the GreenIT.fr collective, and from Frederic Bordage\u0026rsquo;s excellent book, \u0026ldquo;Eco-conception Web: les 115 bonnes pratiques\u0026rdquo;.\nLydia introduced the 115 eco-design levers, categorized by priority and by field:\nSpecification: The first lever to limit impact, and the good news is that only 5% of the checklist practices are needed to make improvements! UX/UI Design: The second lever with already more practices to implement (24%). The eco-design levers rely for two-thirds on the upstream phases of building a business process (specification, functional design, technical design). The remaining one-third is divided between two-thirds for hosting and one-third for implementation. So, eco-design is primarily not a developer\u0026rsquo;s responsibility as one might think! Technical Implementation: 62% of the practices help improve this phase. Hosting: 5% of the practices. Marketing/Analytics: 4% of the practices. CBTW recommends focusing efforts on the following points:\nSustainable software design Electronic waste optimisation and management Cloud infrastructure and data centers optimization Sustainable software design # To achieve this, CBTW encourages:\nimplementing Product Design phases to identify the truly necessary features, thus avoiding unnecessary development that consumes resources adopting a modular and scalable design to ensure systems are flexible, easily adaptable, and capable of evolving with future changes optimizing resources and content to improve the performance and efficiency of solutions, as well as their carbon footprint optimizing code to improve efficiency, speed, and maintainability while ensuring optimal performance across a wide range of devices. Electronic Waste Optimization and Management # For this, CBTW suggests:\nbuying responsibly, prioritizing equipment suited to needs, certified as ecological, refurbished if possible, and easily repairable renting or sharing machines for temporary needs (e.g., rentshop.ch or liverental.ch) disposing of functional equipment by donating it to Emmaus, Caritas, or even Videologic disposing of non-functional equipment by dropping it off with Swico, who will collect it free of charge for at least 250 kg of equipment. Cloud infrastructure and data centers optimization # CBTW suggests:\nadopting eco-design techniques, prioritizing local data processing, implementing lightweight architectures, and using efficient algorithms choosing Cloud storage, such as AWS or Azure, provided the hosting is in a data center with a low PUE (Power Usage Effectiveness) and powered by low-carbon energy integrating eco-design into company policy, developing a dedicated CSR strategy, and setting up green KPIs, monitoring, and audits. To explore further, I highly recommend downloading the complete checklist, buying the book \u0026ldquo;Eco-conception Web: les 115 bonnes pratiques\u0026rdquo; by Frederic Bordage, or even participating in the collective\u0026rsquo;s open-source project, whose source is available on GitHub.

So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes). Resilio Tech demonstration by Amael Parreaux-Ey (Resilio) Resilio is an EPFL spinoff, strongly inspired by the GreenIT.fr collective.\nInstead of simply giving us a demonstration of the Resilio tech tool, Amael recontextualised the reason for the carbon footprint and why it should be exceeded, starting with the 9 planetary limits, 6 of which have unfortunately already been exceeded\u0026hellip;\nAmael reminded us that there are 3 priority regulations for the digital sector, which will govern the environmental declaration of companies, whether for their products, activities or suppliers:\nThe duty of care stemming from the CSDDD (Corporate Sustainability, Due Diligence Directive) requiring large companies and their business partners to prevent, stop or mitigate the negative impact of their activities on human rights and the environment from 2025-2026. Company footprint resulting from the CSRD (Corporate Sustanaibility Reporting Directive) requiring companies and institutions to provide standardised extra-financial reporting on 10 standards from 2025 (climate change, pollution, water and marine resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, use of resources and circular economy, human workforce, workers in the value chain, communities affected, consumers and end users, business conduct). Product footprint resulting from the Green claims voted in April 2024 aimed at preventing greenwashing and enabling consumers to make informed purchasing decisions. A carbon footprint only covers the climate change standard. A LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) is a holistic method covering the first 5 environmental standards.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s true that in France, whether it\u0026rsquo;s politicians or the media, they only talk about climate change and omit the 8 other planetary limits. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it any easier to understand the regulations and adopt the associated constraints. Amael then presents Resilio\u0026rsquo;s overall LCA approach, which is divided into 4 stages:\nPrepare: definition of the scope of the study and preparatory work. Carry out: collection of physical inventory data and assessment of the organisation\u0026rsquo;s maturity via a review of best practices Validate: organise the data collected, validate the inventory and check the consistency of the data, then calculate the footprint and maturity. Act: take stock in terms of inventory, footprint and maturity, benchmark the footprint against the average of companies already studied, make recommendations for building the action plan, present the results to the project team, then simulate the plan\u0026rsquo;s actions. Personally, I feel that there is one point missing from the approach described: raising employee awareness on sustainable IT, in order to make it easier and more transparent to gather data and take action once the plan has been drawn up. Knowing Resilio, this aspect is also covered in their approach, and brilliantly so by Celine Carle-Faye, head of training and gamification at Resilio. Once this context had been described, Amael showed us some screenshots of the Resilio tech tool, and in particular :\nInventory supervision; Collection of the inventory, which can be done by importing the export file from a CMDB, by entering the technical characteristics of the equipment (storage, memory, etc.) or by entering the equipment reference; Collecting the information needed to assess the organisation\u0026rsquo;s maturity.

So this is a great opportunity for me to share with you the conferences I attended. The forum took place over two days, on 26 and 27 September 2024 respectively.There were several conference formats on the menu: Demonstration (20 minutes), Workshop (20 minutes), Conference (40 minutes), Round Table (60 minutes). Conference hosted by Helene Levrault from Verdikt\nAfter a brief presentation of her company Verdikt, Helene would like to share three different pieces of feedback on the implementation of sustainable IT.\nThe CSR impact of IT in a large company # This large company employs over 80,000 people in more than 100 business units around the world. The company is one of the leaders in sustainable IT and is looking to improve and manage its impact far beyond carbon.\nIn three months, across 20 business units, with over 200,000 pieces of IT equipment and millions of Cloud usages, the company\u0026rsquo;s impact analysis showed a score of 51/100, which may not seem like much at first glance, but nevertheless places the company in the top 10% in terms of maturity, with less than 500 kg CO2 equivalent per employee.\nThe benefits of this maturity analysis include\nfacilitating management sponsorship and employee commitment; identify the priorities to be addressed identify possible cost optimisations. The next steps for this company are\ndefine a strategy for implementing the action plans extend the approach to other business units automate data collection and monitoring. The CSR impact of digital products # The head of the digital factory department of a company with over 160,000 employees, operating in several countries around the world, and with over 1,000 applications in its portfolio wanted to carry out a multi-dimensional audit to come up with actionable recommendations and comply with regulatory frameworks.\nIn 3 months, Verdikt analysed two web applications, managed by a team distributed around the world, with a total of 15,000 users per month. The analysis of the company\u0026rsquo;s impact showed a score between 40 and 60, with one application closer to 40 and the other closer to 60. Verdikt provided around 170 recommendations to improve the environmental impact of these two applications.\nOnce the action plan had been implemented, the team was able to reduce the impact of its web applications by around 30%, gaining 20 points on the maturity score and moving them into the top 1%.\nThe next steps for the company are to:\nscale up the approach to cover all the applications in the portfolio under management train employees in sustainable development monitor the objectives to be achieved The CSR impact of IT Projects # For this third and final feedback session, Helene tells us about a CIO from a company with 50,000 employees managing 100 projects, each worth more than one million euros. The CIO wanted to evaluate and compare different scenarios across all types of projects. To do this, Verdikt assessed three pilot projects, each exceeding 5 million euros, over a period of 3 months:\nan industrial systems refurbishment project, a digital workplace strategy project, a business process digitalization project. The analysis provided an assessment of the projects\u0026rsquo; carbon emissions in tCO2 equivalents, although the specific figures were not provided.\nFrom this analysis, the company was able to introduce a new RoE (Return on Environment) KPI, which all projects must evaluate before receiving funding for launch.\nOn this conference, I found it interesting to see the areas where companies are focusing their efforts to reduce the environmental impact of their activities. However, I was disappointed by how these three cases were only briefly covered. It left me wanting more. I would have preferred a single, more detailed presentation, with the participation of the company involved.

Box\nAs I teach all the novice product managers for whom I introduce product management, it is interesting to use models like those of Roman Pichler because they provide a framework and an approach that guides the implementation of a product approach. But they remain models that will certainly need to be adapted to the contexts in which they are applied.\nProduct approach # Roman Pichler breaks down his Product approach into 5 artefacts, from the most strategic to the most tactical:\nThe product vision describes the ultimate reason why the product is created; The product strategy indicates how the vision will be achieved; The product roadmap indicates how the strategy will be implemented; The product backlog contains the details needed to develop the product as described in the roadmap, including the epics and user stories. The sprint goal describes the purpose of a sprint and indicates why it is worth undertaking this sprint. To find out more about Roman Pichler\u0026rsquo;s approach to product management, feel free to read his book and visit his blog. Product vision board # This cartouche helps you to describe, visualise and validate your product\u0026rsquo;s vision and strategy. It identifies the target group, the needs, the main characteristics and the company\u0026rsquo;s objectives. The vision thus described becomes the North Star of the Product team working to fulfil this vision.\nIn my experience, I use workshops such as User role modeling and Impact mapping to define this cartouche. It\u0026rsquo;s extremely effective!\nDownload the Product vision board template Goal-oriented product roadmap # Unlike traditional feature-based roadmaps, the GO product roadmap is goal-oriented. Its objectives describe outcomes or benefits such as user acquisition, activation and retention, which form the backbone of the plan. This moves the discussion from functionality to value creation, making intelligent investment decisions and aligning stakeholders and development teams. This roadmap is a very simple and effective document for communicating and discussing with your stakeholders.\nAn Impact mapping approach can be used to fill this template effectively.\nDownload the GO product roadmap template Sprint goal board # A sprint goal, if applied correctly, states the outcome of the sprint and guides the work of the development team. Unfortunately, many teams don\u0026rsquo;t use sprint goals at all or apply them to state the stories to be implemented rather than the purpose of the sprint. Roman Pichler\u0026rsquo;s template helps you formulate effective sprint goals by answering the following three questions: Why do the sprint? How will you achieve the desired result? And how will you know when the objective has been achieved?\nDownload the sprint goal template ","date":"22 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/references/strategize/","section":"References","summary":"Roman Pichler\u0026rsquo;s book Strategize details an extremely effective approach to digital product management.","title":"Strategize","type":"references"},{"content":" In 2021, as part of our book club at SoKube, Laurent Speyser suggested we read \u0026ldquo;Team topologies\u0026rdquo; by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais.

Interaction topologies # There are 3 types of interaction:\ncollaboration: encourages collective intelligence to create new services, but costs an organisation a lot in terms of coordination and clarity of responsibilities; facilitation: mainly used by enabling teams to pass on knowledge and know-how to a team; X-as-a-service: the target for any company in terms of team interactions, by making interactions between teams explicit; one team provides a service that another team consumes.

There are many programming languages used to create software. Whether imperative, declarative, functional, logical, object-oriented or event-driven, all languages are ultimately interpreted by a processor as binary code (a sequence of 0s and 1s). From a purely physical point of view, binary code is nothing more than a sequence of electrical state changes. As a result, software is often perceived as immaterial and, at first glance, has no direct impact on the environment.\nThe impact of digital technology on the environment # In 2019, the digital industry accounted for 3.8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, almost double those generated by the air transport industry. If software itself has no direct impact on these emissions, where does the impact come from? In its study on the environmental footprint of digital technology, the GreenIT.fr collective reveals that almost 70% of the industry\u0026rsquo;s impact is linked to users, who own over 34 billion digital devices, with the other impacts shared between networks and data centers. The number of devices per person continues to grow, and reports from the Shift Project estimate that it could reach 50 billion by 2025, or even 100 billion by 2030. The manufacture of these devices, which is the most polluting phase, adds considerably to the environmental footprint of digital technology.\nThe “Bloatware” problem # A key factor contributing to this over-consumption of hardware is the proliferation of bloatware. This term refers to increasingly resource-hungry software, which requires ever more powerful hardware to function properly. Over the years, despite the exponential increase in processor power (according to Moore\u0026rsquo;s Law), software has become slower and heavier, a phenomenon known as Wirth\u0026rsquo;s Law. This means that the growing inefficiency of software is offsetting, if not outstripping, gains in hardware performance.\nA striking example of this inefficiency is the contrast between the storage requirements of a computer that put men on the Moon (72 KB) and the requirements of a simple HTML e-mail today, which require more memory. Bloatware imposes continuous pressure to renew devices, contributing to the sector\u0026rsquo;s growing carbon footprint. In its 2021 digital barometer, ARCEP states that in more than a third of cases, we renew our smartphones for “software” reasons (the operating system can no longer be updated, the smartphone starts to lag\u0026hellip;).\nConsequences and solutions # Bloatwares therefore have an indirect but significant environmental impact. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that developers are often not trained to optimize software resource usage. Bloatware is the result of a lack of awareness of good programming practices and eco-design, which could help reduce the environmental footprint of software by optimizing its efficiency and minimizing its need for material resources.\nConclusion: the urgent need for eco-designing digital services # Given the impact of bloatware, the eco-design of digital services appears to be a necessary solution. However, it remains under-adopted, often due to a lack of awareness. Companies need to realize that eco-design is not just the responsibility of developers, but should be integrated right from the functional and technical design phases. Adopting this approach could not only reduce environmental impact, but also offer competitive advantages, strengthen business resilience in the face of dwindling resources, and comply with growing regulatory requirements.\n","date":"4 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/impact-environnemental-logiciels/","section":"Posts","summary":"Software, although virtual, has a real environmental impact.

Despite a complicated energy context, SIG is redoubling its efforts to accelerate the energy and environmental transition in Geneva.\nGuillaume Estoup, head of SIG\u0026rsquo;s Digital Factory unit, and Vincent Loiseau, SoKube\u0026rsquo;s Agile coach, give you an insight into the bottom-up approach used to initiate the transition from a project-oriented to a product-oriented organisation.\nWhy did SIG embark on such an adventure? # Numerous parallel and uncoordinated initiatives are launched around the same value chain or business process, generating additional costs and increasing the complexity of the information system. Project management is tied to the demands made by business departments, for whom it is important to get started as soon as possible. Here we recognise the false belief that the earlier you start something, the quicker you finish it. Deliveries are chaotic and users have little impact on value creation, creating a tunnel effect Employees are assigned to numerous activities at the same time (frequent changes of context, reduced efficiency, overload, fatigue). Arbitration based on the availability of resources (rather than on content) is far too frequent The average time taken to process requests is considered too long by requesters. Based on this observation, SIG decided to introduce Agility into its organisation in order to optimise value generation, and to define the following objective:\n\u0026ldquo;Depending on the specific context of the teams, put in place the most appropriate organisation to optimise value generation\u0026rdquo;.\n– Guillaume Estoup (SIG)\nWhat are the expected ambitions and the obstacles identified? # This main objective has been broken down into three major ambitions:\nReduce the Time To Market: on average, the delivery time for small requests of less than 3 days\u0026rsquo; workload was more than 4 months. Improve the efficiency of value delivery, by focusing not on optimising working time but on optimising the time taken to deliver requests Improving the quality of deliverables to limit the need to maintain information system solutions in operational condition. Having high ambitions is all well and good, but being prepared for a challenging road to achieving them is even better. This is why SIG has clearly identified its weak points in order to integrate them into the transformation process:\nSIG has an industrial corporate culture whose historical project management is based on a very high level of certainty SIG\u0026rsquo;s budgeting process is based on project allocation. Once these projects have been selected, resources are allocated to them. Each business unit manages its own project portfolio, resulting in identical or very similar but uncoordinated initiatives. Reduce Time To Market # SIG has set itself an initial intermediate objective, namely to deliver value earlier by reducing the Time To Market from 4 months to 2 months over the next two years. To achieve this, we worked on the following three aspects:\nbuilding solutions in increments using a value-oriented approach, defining Minimum Viable Products (or MVPs), and identifying and simplifying the value-creation flows; facilitate good decision making via an empirical approach, by learning to manage uncertainty, by experimenting and by having the right level of skills in the teams; accelerate decision-making via a [team topologies] approach (/content/references/team-topologies/index.md), by delegating decisions as far as possible to the teams for the subjects they master, and by working to limit dependencies between the different teams and expertise outside the teams. Improving efficiency # What cannot be measured cannot be improved.\n– Peter Drucker\nOur first actions were to acquire the means to measure activities in order to better understand where we were not efficient, to limit manual operations, which were major sources of error, and to rationalise interactions with external teams. We adopted a value stream approach.\nTo improve efficiency, we had to imperatively limit work in progress, by making people understand and apply the principle of ‘Stop starting, start finishing’. To do this, we set up Product Teams in which we delegated priority management to the Product Owners. We instructed managers to limit the number of employees to a maximum of two teams in order to automatically reduce the cost of coordination. Within the teams, we encouraged them to limit work in progress by proposing to define work-in-progress limits according to their context.\nAnd finally, efficiency is only possible if skills are present and shared. We have therefore set up communities of practice based on Product Owners and Scrum Masters training courses. We have also formalised the creation of a FinOps team to help our employees develop their skills in the financial impact of developing cloud-native applications.\nImproving quality # Who would be prepared to cross this monkey bridge? Especially without checking its quality? Not many! And yet in the IT world, people are prepared to work without a safety net. Odd, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? As with improving efficiency, the first step is to measure to raise awareness of the technical debt of current solutions. We then gradually improved the teams\u0026rsquo; definition of done (DoD) by putting in place an increasingly large and solid safety net using a shift left testing approach. The quality of deliveries began to improve, making it easier to generate valuable feedback. To further reinforce this awareness of developing products in the right way, while ensuring that the cost of maintaining them in operational condition was as low as possible, we empowered the teams by giving them responsibility for operating what they were building, and for deploying it themselves in production by structuring and automating the deployment processes.\nWhat has been done to achieve these ambitions? # An Agile organisational transformation is first and foremost the learning of a new working culture, which is acquired and built step by step. So we didn\u0026rsquo;t take a big bang approach to this change and had to listen to three different triggering events.\nThe first is the operational opportunity. When a project is a candidate for doing things differently and accelerating the delivery of value, we jump at the opportunity and share the lessons learned with the other teams. For example, we built a product team with a strong focus on time to market and the ability to build and operate a new solution.\nThe second trigger was the desire to experiment in order to improve team efficiency. For each experiment, we looked to see which team could be a candidate.\nThe final trigger was the desire of the business departments to work differently. This trigger came about after we had had several resounding successes in the company. So we started by raising the awareness of the business units before helping them to identify opportunities for experimentation.\nWe learned the Agile culture empirically, by bringing on board people who were motivated by the change. This way, we didn\u0026rsquo;t get bogged down in useless and humanly complicated coaching.\nFinally, we set up a governance team whose objectives were to :\nprioritise the cross-functional projects to be experimented (training course, quality of deliverables, community of practice, etc.) monitor the progress of these projects using a kanban board encourage the sharing of knowledge by carrying out retrospectives of these projects.

Or perhaps you\u0026rsquo;ve already taken part, or even just watched, full of hope for the changes it would bring?\nThe euphoria of the early days often comes up against the structure of the organisation, putting the brakes on the enthusiasm of the most willing and giving way to a certain weariness. But all hope is not lost! History will not repeat itself endlessly.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to share with you an experience of creating a Product team within a company that has historically been organised to carry out projects. We relied in particular on the concepts of Team Topologies to bring out the responsibility for the product, guarantee a strong decoupling from other products/services, and limit the cognitive load on the team.\nContext # A Swiss company in the energy sector, historically organised to carry out projects, decided to set up a multi-fluid remote reading platform (water, gas, electricity, heat) so that its customers could recover and thus reduce the energy consumption recorded on their meters.\nCourageous decisions are being taken # The time allowed to make this platform available to its customers is just 3 months, compared with the company\u0026rsquo;s average delivery time for this type of solution of 5 months. The company also wanted to take advantage of this new project to acquire expertise in the development of cloud-native solutions.\nThis meant thinking outside the box. To facilitate learning and experimentation, a multidisciplinary team was set up specifically for this project. This team was then able to put in place a working framework that encouraged empirical approaches. Authorisation to deviate from certain company rules was quickly granted. Weekly monitoring to management was introduced to remove the organisational constraints that the team would have to face. Everything was being put in place to give the team as much autonomy as possible and enable it to overcome the technical and organisational challenge.\nTeam composition # For the first time, the company has put in place a multidisciplinary team, including :\nan electrical engineer, coordinating the installation of the sensors and stock management; a telecom engineer, in charge of data communication between the sensors and the web platform; three full stack .Net developers, in charge of developing the web platform; a DevOps engineer in charge of integrating and deploying the web platform on Azure; a software architect, to facilitate the design of the solution architecture; a product manager, responsible for the vision and strategy of the web platform. Unfortunately, some members of this team could not be 100% dedicated. Fortunately, we were able to obtain from management :\nthe limitation of the assignment of these people to a maximum of two projects, including our own; the ability to decide together which days we could work together. Minimum Viable Product # Uncertainty about how to deal with the constraints of development in the cloud and the 3-month deadline for delivering value to customers forced the team to focus on defining the ‘Minimum Viable Product’. The first task was therefore to identify the value stream, which made it possible to select the mandatory activities and identify the business services that could be reused without complexity for the team.\nThe team therefore decided :\nto build few operating tools, given the low volume of sensors to be managed initially (\u0026lt;100); to minimise work on the ergonomics of configuration management activities and adding sensors to the platform by only providing the service in the form of command lines; For the time being, all the complex integration issues with the company\u0026rsquo;s departments (management of orders and sensor stock) have been set aside. As is often the case at the start of a project, the team thought that once all the difficult decisions had been taken and the contours of the product defined, the creation of the platform would just be a long, quiet river. It turned out to be quite the opposite\u0026hellip;\nUsed to having an infrastructure available on its premises, the team paid no attention to the cost of its solution in the cloud. It was setting up multiple environments (dev, qual, prod) that ran all the time, with a large volume of data for which no constraints on their lifespan were taken into account.\nCreating the ‘Device to cloud’ data flow was simple to implement. The opposite ‘Cloud to device’ flow was really problematic for the team.\nA service interruption on the test sensors was caused by a poorly validated change to the database structure. This identified a gap in the definition of our requirements for operating the solution with confidence: the ability to replay past events.\nFortunately, to overcome these difficulties, the team was able to rely on:\nan empirical approach focused on value; a sense of solidarity and team spirit built up step by step; management that listens and is pro-active; a solution-oriented rather than a problem-oriented approach. 1st delivery to the customer # Traditionally, as with any project-oriented organisation, the team was assessed on its ability to achieve the intrinsic objectives, i.e. ‘on time’, ‘functional scope achieved’ and ‘within budget’. The team met these ‘classic’ objectives. However, it had also set itself other, extrinsic objectives, precursors of a product-oriented approach:\ncustomer satisfaction management satisfaction with the efficiency of a multi-skilled cross-functional team; the team\u0026rsquo;s satisfaction with the work carried out and the lessons learned (technical, functional and human); Scalability of the service offered by the platform (at both technical and operational levels). Apart from this last point, all the team\u0026rsquo;s objectives have been met.\nA service is born with new challenges # A project comes to an end. It\u0026rsquo;s time to break up the team so that staff can be assigned to other projects! How often have you seen this in project-oriented organisations? All too often in my case. Fortunately, as the management committee was closely monitoring the team and as the project was a real success, they quickly agreed to launch another experiment: ‘You build it, you run it!\nAn agreement was reached to keep a stable team for a year, financed 60% by the revenue it generated, with the remaining 40% to be found by the Product Manager and the sales teams. The team was now to develop and operate the platform.\nBenefits of experimentation # Without going into detail about all the experiments carried out with this team, at the end of just over two years\u0026rsquo; work, here are the main benefits identified:\nan ability to pivot the product in response to changes in the company\u0026rsquo;s strategy an ability to keep the cost of the platform lean, thanks to a FinOps approach low technical debt optimised operating costs a significant reduction in the burden on managers of managing budgets and capacity schedules Key success factors # Management that listens and is pro-active A willingness to experiment A multi-skilled team to facilitate decision-making An empirical approach to address complexity A structured product approach based on objectives Team topologies to define the product\u0026rsquo;s contours and facilitate interaction with other teams.
